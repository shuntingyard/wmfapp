# WatchMyFollies (wmf)

A very unfinished and nerdy app (SQL interface) to see what's up (in terms of quality, summary activity) with yours (or someone else's) Twitter followers.

# TODO

- [ ] Make logging work.
- [ ] Refactor persistence parts.
- [ ] Refactor for nice scheduling.
- [ ] Expose a minimum of useful command line options.
- [ ] Add a module for auth stuff.
- [x] Improve usability of script for credentials generation.
- [ ] Possibly add some kind of web interface (for credentials AND to replace SQL).
