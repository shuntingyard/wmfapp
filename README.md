# WatchMyFollies (wmf)

A very unfinished and nerdy app (SQL interface) to see what's up (in terms of
quality, summary activity) with yours (or someone else's) Twitter followers.

## TODO

- [x] Improve usability of script for credentials generation.
- [ ] Make logging work.
- [ ] Refactor persistence parts.
- [ ] Refactor for nice scheduling.
- [ ] Expose a minimum of useful command line options.
- [ ] Add a module for authentication stuff.
- [ ] Add analytics like in <https://www.mcschindler.com/twitter-im-umbruch-wie-weiter-eine-analyse-und-grundlagen-fuer-den-entscheid/>
(or more).
- [ ] Possibly add some kind of web interface (for credentials AND to replace SQL).
